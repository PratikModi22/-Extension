#1Ô∏è‚É£ Extension Not Working?
Make sure you're logged into LinkedIn before scraping.
Ensure your profile URL is correct (linkedin.com/in/your-profile).
If you see an error like "Failed to extract LinkedIn data.", the API may be down.

Make sure your API key is valid in background.js.
Try using a different scraper API (e.g., BrightData, SerpApi).
Open Chrome DevTools (Ctrl + Shift + J) and check for console errors.
